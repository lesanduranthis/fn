 <h1>Arm wrestling (also spelled armwrestling) is a sport with two opponents who face each other with their bent elbows placed on a table and hands firmly gripped, who then attempt to force the opponent's hand down to the table top ("pin" them). The sport is often casually used to demonstrate the stronger person between two or more people. Arm wrestling is an ancient sport that was revived in the 1950s in the United States. In September 1962, the first world wrestling championship was held in Petaluma, California, as this wrestling was called (literally, “wrist wrestling”).</h1>
 
 <h2>THERE ARE SOME TECHNIQUES THAT WE CAN USE IN ARMWRESTLING</h2> 

 <p>     <P>

    
    <p>♚Place your right foot forward if you wrestle with your right arm, and vice versa. Your weight will shift from your forward foot to your back foot.Advertisement</P>
    
    
   <p> ♚Curl your thumb. After both people bring their hands together, put your thumb underneath your fingers. Doing this helps will help execute a technique called the top roll.</P>
   
   <p>♚Have your abdomen close to the table.If you have your right foot forward, your right hip will be up against the table.</P>
 
    <p>♚Keep your upper arm close to your body. This way, your body and arm strength will be used at the same time, rather than using your arm strength alone.</P>

    <p>♚Get a high grip on the opponent's hand. Get your fingers over the nail of your thumb.Advertisement</P>

    <p>♚Raise your wrist. In turn, bending the other person's wrist forward, will make your grip stronger, as they struggle to keep their grip. If you can't do this, just keep your wrist straight.</P>

    <p>♚Draw your opponent to the corner (As you push down, pull their hands toward you) to get their arm open. When their arm is at the precise angle pushed down, they'll have to work hard to bring it back up.</P>

    <p>♚Use one of the following techniques, depending on your situation.The hook - This technique is useful if you're as strong as your opponent in either forearm strength, bicep strength, or both.Curl inwards your wrist. This will extend your opponent's arm, but will require you to put a lot of bicep power in.Maintain wrist contact throughout the match so that force is delivered through the wrists, rather than the hands.Get your body (especially the shoulder) over your arm and keep your body and arm close together. Drag your opponent towards you as you push it down.The top roll - This move is more about leverage than brute strength. You put pressure on your opponent's hand, forcing it open and making it more difficult for him to use his muscles.Get your elbows close together. The resulting height gives you more of an advantage. Achieve as high a grip as possible on their soon as you hear the word "go" pull your hand towards you, pulling your opponent’s hand away from their body. This can help you get a higher grip. In this technique you will pull your body back.As you push their hand down, pull the opponent's wrist back. Their palm should rotate towards the ceiling.</P>

    <p>♚To finish your opponent, rotate your body and position your shoulder with the direction you want your arm to go.That way, you'll be able to use your shoulder strength and body weight to win.</P>
